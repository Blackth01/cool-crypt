# cool-crypt
Python program to easily decrypt or encrypt files from a directory


## Usage

The script can be started with the command "python3 cool_crypt.py", and then it will ask the information needed to encrypt or decrypt the files. It can also receive a parameter "e", for encryption, or "d", for decryption, in order for it to already start in encryption or decryption mode, and then it'll ask for the remaining information needed. Example: "python3 cool_crypt.py e" or "python3 cool_crypt d".
